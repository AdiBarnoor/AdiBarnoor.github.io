Hi! Welcome to my page.
I am a second year MSc student of the Molecular and Cellular Neurobiology track in the [Weizmann Istitute of Science](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/pages/).
I am a member of Ido Amit's lab, which focuses on immunology and all its aspects. I am very passionate about the brain and molecular biology and right now my research involves microglia, which are a part of the immune system of the brain.
